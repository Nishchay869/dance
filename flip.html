         <div class="about-1">
            <p class="para-1">Bharatanatyam is the oldest and most popular classical dance of India. It originated in Tamil Nadu and was first performed in temples as an offering to gods. The name Bharatanatyam comes from Bhava (expression), Raga (music), Tala (rhythm), and Natya (dance). This dance is based on stories from Hindu epics and Puranas, especially connected to Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. Bharatanatyam dancers wear colorful silk costumes, ornaments, flowers, and bells (ghungroo) on their feet. They also decorate their hands and feet with red color to make movements more clear. The dance uses graceful hand gestures (mudras), facial expressions (abhinaya), and rhythmic steps to tell stories. Carnatic music is usually used for performances. The dance is divided into parts like Alaripu, Jatiswaram, Varnam, and Tillana. It is famous for the Nataraja pose, which represents Lord Shiva as the cosmic dancer. Bharatanatyam requires dedication and practice, and it reflects devotion, discipline, and the rich culture of India.</p>
